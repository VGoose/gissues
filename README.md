## Description
Git Issues Viewer SPA
Built with: 
- React
- Redux
- Styled Components
- Jest

## Installation
Clone and install with `npm install` or `yarn`.  
Run locally with `npm run start` or `yarn start`.

## Dependency Choices
- create-react-app for starter boilerplate 
- react-beautiful-dnd for drag and drop
- moment.js for time from now
- redux-starter-kit for redux boilerplate

## Improvements with more time
- first time writing styled-components, component/file structure could be organized better
- first time using redux-starter-kit, file structure/organization could be better
- more test coverage, test action creators, test against bigger repos, with lots of issues
- possible caching performance with JSON.parse/stringify
- add animation to make transitions less jarring
- use loading states to show loading animations
